This repository is for the config file for dnsmasq to filter the queries and allow only the whitelisted queries.
To use the functionality of this file, first you must download and install dnsmasq by using sudo apt-get install dnsmasq.
Then enable and run the dnsmasq using sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq and sudo systemctl start dnsmasq.
make a copy of dnsmasq.conf using cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.unlock to be used when the machine needs updating.
Move and replace the dnsmasq.conf in /etc/ with the one from the repo.
or append the config file to the dnsmasq.conf.
make a copy of the this config file too using cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.lock or any name you like. Naming it 
this way helps in identifying the file
The two extra copies of dnsmasq configuration file help to lock and unlock the network whenever we want to. We just have to copy the content
to the dnsmasq.conf file.

nslookup file give the list of domain and ip we are whitelisting.
